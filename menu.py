class Menu:
    """
    The main menu class that handles the game menu.

    The stack attribute is a handy way to keep track of the menu screens.
    Each menu screen is a separate class that inherits from the MenuFactory class.
    By storing them in a stack (FILO), we can easily navigate between them by pushing and popping screens.
    This allows us to keep an history of the screens and even store data between them.
    For example, when generating a custom labyrinth, pressing the "back" button will keep the
    Previous settings instead of resetting them.

    Attributes:
        quit (bool): Flag to indicate if the game should quit.
        screen (pygame.Surface): The game screen.
        stack (list): A stack to keep track of the menu screens.
